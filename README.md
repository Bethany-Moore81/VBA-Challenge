# VBA-Challenge
Week 2 Challenge

For this challenge I spent a lot of time on trial and error using my current Excel/VBA knowledge and notes from our classes.  That was not very successful so I started looking up parts on Google.  I eventually ran into the correct code on GitHub as sited below.  I used this site to clean up what I had, better organize the flow, and add much better comment descriptors. I also used the conditioanl formatting coding as I was doing this via Excel but was able to add it to the VBA with the information on this site.
